note: it takes up to a minute for Replit to install the nltk libraries when you run it the first time.

### Description:
Inspired by the 90's TV show ["IT crowd"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAtLkuuNJE) IT Crowd is an attempt of a funny version of a IT
support chatbot with hardcoded questions and answers. I hope you enjoy testing it as much as I enjoyed creating it. The chatbot is built using NLTK Python libraries. https://www.nltk.org/
